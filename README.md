# [四大方言与普通话对比数据集]  
## Beijing, Dongbei, Shandong and Cantonese Dialect Contrast Corpus  

**Abstract**  
This dataset provides 15 hours of annotated audio recordings covering four major Chinese dialects (Beijing, Northeastern, Shandong, Cantonese) with parallel Mandarin translations. Each dialect utterance is segmented at character level, annotated with English glosses and Universal POS tags, enabling cross-dialect linguistic analysis and ASR model training. Data was collected from authentic scenarios like family conversations and market interactions, with rigorous anonymization to protect speaker privacy. The corpus aims to preserve endangered dialect features and serve as a benchmark for computational dialectology. Available under CC-BY-NC 4.0 license at [GitHub Link] and [HuggingFace Link].
